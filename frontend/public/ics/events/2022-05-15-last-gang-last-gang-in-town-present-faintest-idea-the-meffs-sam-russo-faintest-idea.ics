	aJyZUfQmfOUCM5T-ZALy-MPPdjkU** Doors 7:30pm FAINTEST IDEA – Rudeboy street
	 punk! Playing anywhere and everywhere from squats to bars to festival mai
	n stages and drawing inspiration from bands such as The Specials\, Inner T
	errestrials\, The Filaments and Operation Ivy this is angry political comm
	entary that you can shout along to while stomping your feet. Faintest Idea
	 take the bouncing beat of 2 Tone Ska and smash it over the head with fast
	\, angry UK Punk to produce their own sound that is full of energy and wil
	l get you on the dancefloor. Hailing from East Anglia the rabble rousing p
	olitical lyrics are shouted over layers of catchy brass lines and heavy bo
	ot stomping beats. Signed to TNS records the band have extensively toured 
	the UK\, Europe\, Russia\, Canada and Japan and had major airplay on BBC R
	adio 1’s Punk Show with Mike Davies\, being invited down to the legendary 
	Maida Vale Studios in London to record a live session. *https://faintestid
