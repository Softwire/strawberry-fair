DESCRIPTION:By Percy Shelley I met a traveller from an antique land\, Who s
	aid—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert. . . . Near 
	them\, on the sand\, Half sunk a shattered visage lies\, whose frown\, And
	 wrinkled lip\, and sneer of cold command\, Tell that its sculptor well th
	ose passions read Which yet survive\, stamped on these lifeless things\, T
	he hand that mocked them\, and the heart that fed\; And on the pedestal\, 
	these words appear: My name is Ozymandias\, King of Kings\; Look on my Wor
	ks\, ye Mighty\, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of t
	hat colossal Wreck\, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch f
	ar away.”
