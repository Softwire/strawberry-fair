DESCRIPTION:By Lewis Carroll ’Twas brillig\, and the slithy toves Did gyre 
	and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves\, And the mome raths 
	outgrabe. “Beware the Jabberwock\, my son! The jaws that bite\, the claws 
	that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird\, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!” 
	He took his vorpal sword in hand\; Long time the manxome foe he sought— So
	 rested he by the Tumtum tree And stood awhile in thought. And\, as in uff
	ish thought he stood\, The Jabberwock\, with eyes of flame\, Came whifflin
	g through the tulgey wood\, And burbled as it came! One\, two! One\, two! 
	And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it de
	ad\, and with its head He went galumphing back. “And hast thou slain the J
	abberwock? Come to my arms\, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Call
	ay!” He chortled in his joy. ’Twas brillig\, and the slithy toves Did gyre
	 and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves\, And the mome raths
	 outgrabe.
