Can you help us do better?</p>\n<h1>Big Thanks</h1>\n<p>Many thanks to Greenhams and Travis Perkins for giving us very generous discounts on our rubbish bags and sacks; you guys have really gone above and beyond.</p>\n<h2>Mobile phones</h2>\n<p>Strawberry Fair needs your old/unfashionable/megapixelly-challenged phone. Don't throw it in a bin or leave it lurking in the back of a drawer, give it to us... ..and we can turn it into actual fun by the magic of recycling.</p>\n<p>You can drop off your old ones off at these awesomely fab pubs, run by Steve and Hayley, long-time supporters of Strawberry Fair:  The Portland, The Alexandra Arms, or at The Urban Larder - well worth a visit even if you're not weighed down by obsolete portable communications devices.</p>"},"heroData":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"heroData":{"isActive":true,"heroImages":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"641fdd93-ed8b-5b22-a0ad-f3d9af8bdbbd"}}}
