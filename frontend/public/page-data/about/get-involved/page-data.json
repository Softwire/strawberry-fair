If you would like to be part of the largest free festival in the UK you can fill in our <a href=\"https://strawberry-fair.org.uk/admin/#/collections/forms/entries/volunteer-form\"><strong>VOLUNTEER FORM</strong></a>, email us at <a href=\"mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk\"><strong>iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</strong></a> or simply come to one of our meetings and talk to members of the Committee, especially our Volunteer Co-ordinator, Becky Ramshaw. You don't need any particular experience to volunteer with us, and we will provide any training and support needed.</p>\n<h2>Strawberry Fair is a volunteer-run not-for-profit organisation</h2>\n<p>One of the things that make Strawberry Fair and all of our associated events so special is the people that put their time and effort into making our event so unique. Entirely run by a team of volunteers (known collectively as the Fairies) we work year-round across a number of areas, from finding artists and organising stages, through working out how many toilets are needed, to managing traders and fundraising. Whatever your interests and whatever your skills, the Fair needs your help.</p>\n<p>Volunteering for Strawberry Fair is a great opportunity to get experience and develop skills in the events, marketing and arts industries, to meet new people, to get to know your Cambridge community and to have fun - and, of course, a fantastic sense of team achievement when it all comes together on the day itself. Whether you'd like to help with planning throughout the year, the preparation of the site or simply on the day itself, there is always space and we would love to hear from you.</p>\n<p>To get in touch and find out more, please complete our volunteers' enquiry form - We're sure we can find something that you'd be interested in!</p>\n<h1>What we need</h1>\n<p>Can you help us with any of the roles below? How about something else entirely?</p>\n<p>There are a number of jobs we need to fill every year. You can find out a bit more about this below. However, if you feel there's something missing from this list that would improve our event then please either let us know, or even better, come to a meeting and suggest it!</p>\n<p>If you're not sure yet what you'd be interested in doing but would still like to get involved, then come to a meeting anyway and see what takes your fancy. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/strawberryfair/image/upload/v1579684382/Image%20Scrapbook/Gareth_Nunns_259_DSC_7639_xdpod8.jpg\" alt=\"Steward\" class=\"html-embedded-image-medium\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Stewarding</strong></p>\n<p>Stewards are absolutely key to the running of both the Fair and Parade. Stewards usually work in pairs, so it is an excellent way for you and a friend to get involved on the day. They provide information to fair-goers, watch out for health and safety issues, and assist in emergencies. Separately, we also need people to hand out programmes, collect donations and sell our merchandise. Just two hours of your time on the day will help us enormously. <strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk\"><strong>iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</strong></a> <strong>or fill out our</strong> <a href=\"https://strawberry-fair.org.uk/admin/#/collections/forms/entries/volunteer-form\"><strong>VOLUNTEER FORM</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Site Crew</strong></p>\n<p>The Strawberry Fair site crew is renowned across the country as one of the most efficient and 'on the ball' event teams.
