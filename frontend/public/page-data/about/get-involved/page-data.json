If you would like to be part of the largest free festival in the UK you can fill in our volunteer form, email us at <a href=\"mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk\">iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</a> or simply come to one of our meetings and talk to members of the Committee, especially our Volunteer Co-ordinator, Becky Ramshaw. You don't need any particular experience to volunteer with us, and we will provide any training and support needed.</p>\n<h2>Strawberry Fair is a volunteer-run not-for-profit organisation</h2>\n<p>One of the things that make Strawberry Fair and all of our associated events so special is the people that put their time and effort into making our event so unique. Entirely run by a team of volunteers (known collectively as the Fairies) we work year-round across a number of areas, from finding artists and organising stages, through working out how many toilets are needed, to managing traders and fundraising. Whatever your interests and whatever your skills, the Fair needs your help.</p>\n<p>Volunteering for Strawberry Fair is a great opportunity to get experience and develop skills in the events, marketing and arts industries, to meet new people, to get to know your Cambridge community and to have fun - and, of course, a fantastic sense of team achievement when it all comes together on the day itself. Whether you'd like to help with planning throughout the year, the preparation of the site or simply on the day itself, there is always space and we would love to hear from you.</p>\n<p>To get in touch and find out more, please complete our volunteers' enquiry form - We're sure we can find something that you'd be interested in!</p>\n<h1>What we need</h1>\n<p>Can you help us with any of the roles below? How about something else entirely?</p>\n<p>There are a number of jobs we need to fill every year. You can find out a bit more about this below. However, if you feel there's something missing from this list that would improve our event then please either let us know, or even better, come to a meeting and suggest it!</p>\n<p>If you're not sure yet what you'd be interested in doing but would still like to get involved, then come to a meeting anyway and see what takes your fancy. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/strawberryfair/image/upload/v1579684382/Image%20Scrapbook/Gareth_Nunns_259_DSC_7639_xdpod8.jpg\" alt=\"Steward\" class=\"html-embedded-image-medium\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Stewarding</strong></p>\n<p>Stewards are absolutely key to the running of both the Fair and Parade. Stewards usually work in pairs, so it is an excellent way for you and a friend to get involved on the day. They provide information to fair-goers, watch out for health and safety issues, and assist in emergencies. Separately, we also need people to hand out programmes, collect donations and sell our merchandise. Just two hours of your time on the day will help us enormously. <a href=\"mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk\">iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Site Crew</strong></p>\n<p>The Strawberry Fair site crew is renowned across the country as one of the most efficient and 'on the ball' event teams. If you don't mind getting your hands dirty and shifting all kinds of infrastructure (staging, fencing, tables, chairs etc) and are available anytime - even just for one day - during the week before the Fair or a few days afterwards, then please get in touch. No prior experience or skills required, just a smile and a willing disposition. <a href=\"mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk\">iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/strawberryfair/image/upload/v1580042719/Image%20Scrapbook/Gareth_Nunns_017_DSC_6323_dwwkgi.jpg\" alt=\"Site crew\" class=\"html-embedded-image-medium\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Communications &#x26; Publicity</strong></p>\n<p>We love Strawberry Fair and we want the whole of Cambridge to as well.

Strawberry Fair strives to be environmentally friendly so we recycle as much as we can - about 40% at the moment. This year we want to recycle at least 50%, for which we will need your help - just turn up on the day, or the Sunday and Monday after, and ask for a bin bag. Gloves and grabbers are provided, though if you have them please bring your own! Just a couple of hours of your time will really help get Midsummer Common cleared up and given back to the cows. <a href=\"mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk\">iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</a></p>\n<p><strong>Artists/Designers</strong></p>\n<p>Every year we're always looking for the creative types to help us dress and decorate the site &#x26; stage areas, draw funky logos and posters during planning, or create merchandise that we can sell. <a href=\"mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk\">iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</a></p>\n<p><strong>Fundraising</strong></p>\n<p>Strawberry Fair relies on the donations we receive throughout the year and one of the ways to do this is ensuring we are more than just a day in June for the local community.
