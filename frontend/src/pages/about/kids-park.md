With no Strawberry Fair happening in 2020, we're doing what we can to bring you fun and entertaining things to do at home instead! In partnership with Cambridge 105 Radio, we're holding a story competition, and an art compeition. There are prizes to be won and the winners story will be read out on the radio on the 6th June.
