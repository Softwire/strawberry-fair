With no Strawberry Fair happening in 2020, we're doing what we can to bring you fun and entertaining things to do at home instead! In partnership with Cambridge 105 Radio, we're holding a story competition, and an art compeition. There are some great prizes to be won. 

# How to enter

## Story competition

The theme of Strawberry Fair was going to be magic, so we'd love to read your stories on this theme. Please email your magical tales to <mailto:kids@strawberry-fair.org.uk>, ideally less than 500 words, but we'll allow some leeway if you need it. 

The winning story will be read on Cambridge 105 Radio on Saturday 6th of June and we will invite you to tell the story in the Kids Park at Strawberry Fair 2021!

Don't forget to include the first name and age of the storyteller so we can make sure they get the credit!

## Art competition

Sticking with the magical theme, please send us your magical drawings, paintings, photographs or other artistic creations to: <mailto:kids@strawberry-fair.org.uk>. Again, don't forget to include the first name and age of the artist. 

The winnings artworks will be shown on the Strawberry Fair website, the Cambridge 105 Radio website, AND will be displayed in the Kids Park at Strawberry Fair 2021!

## The _same-size-as-everything-else_ print

By entering either competition, you are agreeing that we may use your story or artwork as outlined above. You also consent that we may read out the name of the winners on the radio, and publish them on the Strawberry Fair and Cambridge 105 Radio websites.
