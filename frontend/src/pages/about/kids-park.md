The Strawberry Fair is a free volunteer-run festival that makes an appearance once a year at the
beginning of June run by the people of Cambridge for the people of Cambridge.
For over 40 years we have created a free party in a field for over 35,000 people; a celebration of summer and everything that is local whether it be music or food, community groups, circus, theatre, workshops or crafts. At the very heart of the fair is its commitment to providing a family friendly day out, that appeals to all ages.
The Kids Park is the area dedicated to babies, children and teenagers offering a safe and creative place that is teeming with age-appropriate entertainment, performances and activities to ensure they too have a unique and unforgettable day. The beauty of what we do is that it’s free and inclusive; our ethos is to empower the young ones of Cambridge to be brave and creative and to find inspiration from the things they see and experience. We want them to leave with magical memories of storytelling and craft skills, countryside games, bubbles and dressing up and to go home dreaming of how they can learn something new.
We have only one rule and that’s to be kind .. to each other and our planet.
