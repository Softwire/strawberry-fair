  # Applications are open to trade at Strawberry Fair on 6th June 2020


  We are looking for traders and organisations offering as many different
  flavours and tastes, products and produce, weird and wonderful hobbies and
  interesting people to amuse and entertain our visitors. Our market is one of
  the most important features of the Fair - bringing a diverse range of stalls
  right to the heart of Cambridge.


  ## Why Trade at Strawberry Fair?


  * We regularly attract 35,000-40,000 visitors throughout the one day event

  * We are a free event, but many punters tell us they come specifically to buy
  from our market.

  * We reach an eclectic mix of people of all ages including residents, visitors
  and tourists.

  * We do our best to limit the number of similar stalls to ensure that our
  traders are offering different things.

  * We offer a range of pitch fees and types to suit all needs, including food
  stalls, craft stalls, blanket pitches, mobile sellers and charity stands.

  Applications for food trader pitches at the 2020 fair are open until 29th
  February 2020.


  Food pitches are not allocated on a first come first served basis, as we have
  a limited number of food pitches available. To ensure we can offer a variety
  of cuisines to visitors of the Fair, we will consider all of the applications
  we have received in early spring and make pitch offers to traders at that
  point.


  If you have any questions about selling food or non-alcoholic drinks at
  Strawberry Fair, please see [Trader

We have had to take the difficult decision to cancel [Strawberry Fair in 2020](/news/2020-04-18-strawberry-fair-2020-cancelled/). We have tried to contact all traders to refund any deposits already paid. If you haven't had your deposit returned, please contact <mailto:traders@strawberry-fair.org.uk>. 

The events industry has been hit partifularly hard by the Coronavirus, and we want to thank the traders that support us and we wish you the best during these turbulent times. 

Stay well and see you in 2021 x
