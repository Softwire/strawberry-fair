# Strawberry Fair is a volunteer-run not-for-profit organisation

## Our core beliefs

Our constitution defines what we are and how we operate. As a document, it's pretty dry, but it encapsulates some key points: 

> "The Fair is free to enter and all entertainments and activities are free."

That's everything from watching bands, through kids jumping on bouncy slides and getting their faces painted in the Kids Area, to taking part in workshops.

> "The Fair is for the benefit of the local community, particularly children and young people."

The Fair always has a focus on active community involvement, with space for local people of all ages to create, perform and take part.

Strawberry Fair has always been fiercely independent, steering clear of any major sponsorship and other influences that might undermine this. The bulk of the money for Strawberry Fair comes from our lovely traders who pay to be at the Fair. However, that in itself is not enough and volunteers work year round to raise money to bring Cambridge this free day out, through running events such as The Cambridge Band Competitions, 'open mic' nights, and other fund-raising activities.
