As always, you will find us in the far corner of Midsummer Common next to the Victoria Rd bridge.
It is 25 years since we set up as the original Green Area as a space for environmental and social activists at The Fair.
We will be bringing you a cornucopia of delights including The Soundscape Solar Stage and a host of attractions. We are a generator free zone.
**SOUNDSCAPE SOLAR STAGE:**
