We are proud to collaborate with some outstanding local charities in our fundraising efforts. You will see some great volunteers all around the fair, so please donate any change you have. Remember, we are completely funded by the community, no corporate sponsors!

The charities we are collaborating with this year are:

## Cambridgeshire Search and Rescue (CamSAR)

## (Main gate, Victoria Avenue gate, part of Walnut tree and Mitchums Bridge gate)

Cambridgeshire Search and Rescue (CamSAR) is the  Lowland Search and Rescue Team covering our county, often also assisting sister teams in the wider region.

We are a specialist team, called upon by the Police in the search for vulnerable missing people: a child, an elderly person living with dementia or even someone who is considering taking their own life.  In each case, and many others, an emergency response is vital.

Our Search Technicians, Team Leaders, Search Planners, Search Operations and Search Managers turn out at all hours of the day and night to respond to the missing person’s emergency.

**100% professional**

Working closely with our Lowland Rescue sister teams and other Search and Rescue organisations within the UKSAR Operator Group, every team member is trained to exacting national standards and undergoes yearly recertification through continual training. This ensures seamless interoperability when bringing in external resources to a Cambridgeshire incident or when responding to a mutual aid call elsewhere.

**0% pay**

Available 24/7/365, the team is made up 100% of dedicated fully trained volunteers and receives no government funding, relying entirely upon one-off grants and individual donations – and team members’ own pockets – to continue to provide this service.

"Make a Smile is a volunteering organisation where volunteers dress up as 'characters' and attend a variety of events with children in hardship. Our goal is to help these children to enjoy their childhood. We endeavour to be professional, forward-thinking and well trained but hold at the forefront of our practice that fun is the number one priority for both children and volunteers. "
