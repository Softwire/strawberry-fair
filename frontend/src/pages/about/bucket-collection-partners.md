We are proud to collaborate with some outstanding local charities in our fundraising efforts. You will see some great volunteers all around the fair, so please donate any change you have. Remember, we are completely funded by the community, no corporate sponsors!

The charities we are collaborating with this year are:

# Cambridgeshire Search and Rescue (CamSAR)

## (Main gate, Victoria Avenue gate, part of Walnut tree and Mitchums Bridge gate)

Cambridgeshire Search and Rescue (CamSAR) is the  Lowland Search and Rescue Team covering our county, often also assisting sister teams in the wider region.

We are a specialist team, called upon by the Police in the search for vulnerable missing people: a child, an elderly person living with dementia or even someone who is considering taking their own life.  In each case, and many others, an emergency response is vital.

Our Search Technicians, Team Leaders, Search Planners, Search Operations and Search Managers turn out at all hours of the day and night to respond to the missing person’s emergency.

**100% professional**

Working closely with our Lowland Rescue sister teams and other Search and Rescue organisations within the UKSAR Operator Group, every team member is trained to exacting national standards and undergoes yearly recertification through continual training. This ensures seamless interoperability when bringing in external resources to a Cambridgeshire incident or when responding to a mutual aid call elsewhere.

**0% pay**

Available 24/7/365, the team is made up 100% of dedicated fully trained volunteers and receives no government funding, relying entirely upon one-off grants and individual donations – and team members’ own pockets – to continue to provide this service.

“Cambridge-based charity, Tom's Trust is the UK's only charity dedicated to providing mental health support to children with brain tumours, and their families.



A brain tumour diagnosis is devastating for the whole family. Around 1800 children are diagnosed with childhood cancer in the UK every year. Of which, 600 are children diagnosed with a brain tumour.

Sadly, 1/3 of these children will die and of those that survive, 62% will be left with life-long disabilities (such as blindness, hearing loss, lost motor-function or learning disabilities).

Tom’s Trust clinical psychologists support hundreds of families, working within hospitals in the East, North-East and North-West, helping children from diagnosis, through their brutal treatment and as they return to life at home. It is our mission to reach children with brain tumours and their families in every area of the UK by 2030.

Supporting one child and their family costs £3,335 per year. This includes one-to-one support, vital cognitive assessments, school liaison reintegration, whole-family support, group work and a detailed plan of how to support each child depending on their needs.

## 

Cambridge Convoy Refugee Action Group was founded in 2015 by activists in and around Cambridge, with the aim of coordinating the logistics of sending donations and volunteers to help refugees in the Calais area.

In November 2016 we became a registered charity (number 1170180), and we continue to organise regular weekend trips of volunteers to Calais, assisting the aid organisations there.

We also hold fundraisers and collect donations, as well as raising awareness of the refugee situation in Europe.

As a small and independent charity we are also able to provide funds quickly when there is an urgent need, and have supported various projects in Europe – see camcrag.org.uk/grants for examples.

All the money we raise goes towards providing aid or supporting our convoys: We have no employees, and are entirely run by volunteers.
