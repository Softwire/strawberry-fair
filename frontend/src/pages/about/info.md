## Donate

Strawberry Fair is fully independently and entirely self-funded. With significantly increased costs since Covid, we now have to raise £150k every year and the future of the Fair is less secure than ever so your donations, no matter how big or small are really appreciated.  

**By card:** <https://pay.sumup.io/b2c/Q6SY3650>

**Paypal:** Button below <form target="_top" action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" /> <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="TX2E4BTL9HENG" /> <input type="image" alt="PayPal &ndash; The safer, easier way to pay online." border="0" name="submit" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif" /> <img width="1" alt="" height="1" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/scr/pixel.gif" /></form>

**On site:** Donation buckets and card readers are available at the entrance gates. 

**Businesses:** Click [Here](https://strawberry-fair.org.uk/about/businesses/) for more info from the website on how to donate and get involved. 

But… if you can’t afford it, don’t worry, since 1974 we are proud to keep Strawberry Fair free for everyone to attend, so whilst donations are welcomes, they are not necessary

## Get Involved

We’re all volunteers and it’s never too late to help out at Strawberry Fair. Stewarding even for just two hours on the day would be an incredible help, but there are loads of opportunities to help us build, take down and clear the site too. 

At this stage the easiest option is to come and see us on Midsummer Common so we can find you a suitable role. Ask to be directed to the ‘PRODUCTION OFFICE’. Alternatively, you can email us at [iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk](iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk) and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can. 

It’s a great way to get event experience, we’ll provide you with all the training you need and many of our team use this to go on to do amazing things with the skills they’ve learnt.  

Lastly why not join us as part of the committee to help plan something special for our 50th in 2024.
