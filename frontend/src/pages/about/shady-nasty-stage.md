# Shady Nasty Presents The Fracking Good Oil Co Strawberry Fair

In the south east corner of Strawberry Fair. After being cancelled due to covid, Strawberry Fair is back and with a proper bang. Down at the ShadyNasty HQ we have been putting together one hell of a show with a lineup like no other! Using a mixture of subversive themes and satire the ShadyNasty boys have concocted their best stage show to date!

We will be unleashing onto the common some of the finest funk, punk, brass, drum and bass, Hip Hop and more. We are extremely proud and blessed to welcome to the stage, local Cambridge legend Dirty Dike w/ DJ Sammy B-Side as a headliner!

This is not to be slept on !!!
