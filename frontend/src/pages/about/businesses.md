Strawberry Fair frequently attracts over 40,000 visitors during the course of the day, perusing and buying from the traders, listening to music, and joining in the workshops and activities.

The demographic is very broad, reflecting the great diversity of Cambridge and the regions. Attractions cater to the youngest of the young - for whom the kids area creates special point - to the oldest of the old.There are many ways that businesses can support Strawberry Fair:

## Posters

Would you be happy for us to display posters in your window and help to communicate and market our events to the local community? Even something as simple as this is a great help.

## Programme Advertising

There is an opportunity for a small number of carefully chosen businesses to feature in our souvenir programme. The colour programme will be available to the 30,000 visitors throughout the day and handed out for free across the site. Email <mailto:programme@strawberry-fair.org.uk> for further details.

## Services

From accountancy to marketing, app development to merchandise or insurance to forklift hire, if your business is capable of helping to donate services and reduce our fixed costs, we'd love to hear from you.

## Gifts

We are currently in the process of collecting gifts that could be auctioned off in our upcoming fundraiser. If you have a product, service or an experience that you are willing to donate, please email <mailto:press@strawberry-fair.org.uk>

## Stock

Do you have materials that could be lent or given, to the Fair? Many of our costs are spent on materials we see thrown away in skips all the time. As long as they are structurally safe or in working condition, we won't need first grade stock but items from plyboard to paint, cones to ladders, parade outfits to bin liners, they all come in very handy. If you can donate items to the fair please send an email to <mailto:iwanttohelp@strawberry-fair.org.uk>.

## Financially

Whilst it is a principle of the fair to remain independent, there are ways in which we can support companies that help Strawberry Fair with a donation and we will always show our gratitude to you.To contact us directly about how you could support the Fair in this way, please email Steven at <mailto:treasurer@strawberry-fair.org.uk>.
