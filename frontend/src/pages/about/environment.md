# The Ancient and Esteemed Strawberry Fair Environment Team Invites You To Stick It (In a Bin)!

## **Top things you can do to help the Environment when you visit Strawberry Fair:**

* Recycle, recycle, recycle!!
* Keep tidy. Don’t leave rubbish or equipment
* Reduce all disposable plastic use
* Bring your own water bottle and refill onsite
* Bring your own reusable coffee cup
* Use water wisely
* Cycle or walk -  Keep it Healthy If you’re local then cycle or walk!
* Use public transport where possible
* Car share with friends - Car Share = Less cars = less carbon, pollution, congestion, noise and local impacts
* Cut the Rubbish
* Bring less, produce less and recycle more

**Help!!**

Well, it's not Strawberry Fair's most glamorous job, but someone's got to clear up and recycle after the party.

We need willing bods from Thursday before the Fair to the Wednesday afterwards to help set up, clear up and pack up for possibly the quickest, slickest and greenest litter picking and recycling operation in the entire universe.

To get a warm fuzzy feeling from boldly going where most fairgoers fear to tread, contact our Green Guru and Master of the Bins, Ian, through <mailto:environment@strawberry-fair.org.uk> to find out what's involved.

We usually collect over 10,000 cansfor recycling. Can you help us do better?
