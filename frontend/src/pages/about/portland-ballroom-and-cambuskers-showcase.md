After three long years the **Portland Ballroom** returns to Love our Planet on **Saturday 11th June 2022** at the lovely, free and awesome Strawberry Fair on Midsummer Common, Cambridge.

This year we will be sharing the love and stage with the excellent [**Cambuskers**](http://www.cambuskers.org/).

Thank you to everybody who gives their time and assistance to enable us to put this event on for you. The Fair is **FREE**, Non-sponsored and **Volunteer Run** - anyone interested in helping out please get in touch.

We are raising funds to enable us to bring you the Portland Ballroom@Strawberry Fair 2022 on Sat 11 June. If you can do so please donate a pound or two at [**https://gofund.me/6beb50d5**](https://gofund.me/6beb50d5) so we can carry on providing this amazing free event for our community.

The Portland Ballroom is presented by [**GIGS OUT**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gigsoutineastanglia/?ref=share) in association with the [**East Anglian Festivals Network**](www.eafn.co.uk).

The real ale bar is provided by the very lovely [**Portland Arms**](http://theportlandarms.co.uk/) who also provide the marquee and power for the Ballroom, which is the largest indoor area at the Fair.

Stage Sound and Lighting is from the lovely crew at [**We Are Blueshed**](https://www.weareblueshed.co.uk/) who will again be providing our stage, sound and lighting.
