After three long years the Portland Ballroom returns to Love our Planet on Sat 11 Jun 2022 at the lovely, free and awesome Strawberry Fair on Midsummer Common, Cambridge.

This year we will be sharing the love and stage with the excellent [**Cambuskers**](http://www.cambuskers.org/).

Thank you to everybody who gives their time and assistance to enable us to put this event on for you. The Fair is **FREE**, Non-sponsored and **Volunteer Run** - anyone interested in helping out please get in touch.

We are raising funds to enable us to bring you the Portland Ballroom@Strawberry Fair 2022 on Sat 11 June. If you can do so please donate a pound or two at [**https://gofund.me/6beb50d5**](https://gofund.me/6beb50d5) so we can carry on providing this amazing free event for our community.

The Portland Ballroom is presented by [**GIGS OUT**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gigsoutineastanglia/?ref=share) ****

The real ale bar is provided by the very lovely Portland Arms who also provide the marquee and power for the Ballroom, which is the largest indoor area at the Fair. www.theportland.co.uk .
