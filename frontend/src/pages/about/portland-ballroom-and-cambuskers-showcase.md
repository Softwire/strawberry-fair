After three long years the **Portland Ballroom** returns to Love our Planet on **Saturday 11th June 2022** at the lovely, free and awesome Strawberry Fair on Midsummer Common, Cambridge.

Thank you to everybody who gives their time and assistance to enable us to put this event on for you. The Fair is **FREE**, Non-sponsored and **Volunteer Run** - anyone interested in helping out please get in touch.

We are raising funds to enable us to bring you the Portland Ballroom@Strawberry Fair 2022 on Saturday 3rd June. If you can do so please donate a pound or two at [**https://gofund.me/6beb50d5**](https://gofund.me/6beb50d5) so we can carry on providing this amazing free event for our community.

The Portland Ballroom is presented by [**GIGS OUT**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gigsoutineastanglia/?ref=share) in association with the [**East Anglian Festivals Network**](www.eafn.co.uk).

The real ale bar is provided by the very lovely [**Portland Arms**](http://theportlandarms.co.uk/) who also provide the marquee and power for the Ballroom, which is the largest indoor area at the Fair.

Stage Sound and Lighting is from the lovely crew at [**We Are Blueshed**](https://www.weareblueshed.co.uk/) who will again be providing our stage, sound and lighting.

[**Barton Studios**](https://bartonstudios.webs.com) once again provide us with the stage drum kit.

Why not get involved and become part of our crew - even if it's just a couple of hours stewarding on the day or helping in the set up beforehand and the takedown afterwards, please get in touch. Message us or email to **avalonites@gmail.com**
