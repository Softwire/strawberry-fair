## When and Where is it?

Our licensing conditions prevent you bringing excessive quantities of alcohol (maximum 4 cans of beer, cider, ready to drink cocktails, or 75cl of wine), neat spirits or glass bottles onto site. Random searches will take place. We follow the Challenge 21 policy and are also part of Cambridge Pub Watch.

No video / photo drones are permitted anywhere on site. 

## Can I help you on the day?

Absolutely. Check any of the Get Involved links on this page, or see our section on volunteering with the fair. Every year, a number people volunteer to help with the clean up following the event. If you'd like more information, just ask any of our stewards. 

## How do I get into Strawberry Fair?

There are four pedestrian entrances to the Fair. From Maid's Causeway, Victoria Avenue Bridge, Jesus Green and Walnut Tree Avenue. We suggest you arrive at the Common on foot, by cycle or via public transport. Please do not leave your bicycle secured to the perimeter fence.

## Road/Bridge Closures

The Fort St George bridge will be open to pedestrians and cyclists from 11am for the duration of the event.

## Parking

No parking is available on site. Please visit https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/parking for more information on local car parks or http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/around/park-ride/ for more information on Park and Ride.

## Public Transport





Cambridge has a good network of bus and rail routes into and around the city. Alternatively, ask your taxi driver for Midsummer Common.  



If you are driving to the city, we strongly recommend using the Park and Ride system. The best option is to use Milton Park and Ride to the North of the city as buses will be running until 11pm (via the Citi 2 service). Alternatively Trumpington Park and Ride to the West of the city has the most spaces available, though best suited for families as buses are only running until 8:30pm.

Please note there will be Train Strikes on Friday 2nd and Saturday 3rd June so you will need to find alternative transport if you are intending to come by train. 

## Accommodation/Camping

No camping is permitted on site or in the immediate vicinity of the fair. The Visit Cambridge website http://www.visitcambridge.org/accommodation has information on local accommodation and hotels.
