Back in March 2020 Cambridge Band Competition was well underway when the national lockdown brought it to a halt and ever since then we have been waiting  to start it up again. 

Now the wait is over!

**The Cambridge Band Competition 2020/21 opened for entries on 1st April with entries closing at midnight on 1st June.**

[Band Comp Entry Form](https://strawberry-fair.org.uk/forms/enter-the-band-comp/)

Cambridge Band Competition is about music in all its variety. Applications are welcomed from any performers of original music, from solo performers to full bands.  All genres are acceptable, so long as material is original music. Soloists, comedy musicians, and classical musicians are also encouraged to apply – it’s not just about full bands, the competition is for every musician in Cambridgeshire or within 30 miles of the city of Cambridge. 

The Heats will be held in the Portland Arms on the Saturdays in August with the Final at the Junction on Thursday 24th October. The Band Competition is actually two competitions, the Over 18’s and the Under 18’s. Both competitions will run in tandem with each other, with the heats for the Under 18’s on the Saturday afternoons and the heats for the Over 18’s on the Saturday nights. The final of the Under 18’s Competition will be at The Portland Arms on the last Saturday in August. 

The winner of the Under 18’s Competition will also be a competitor at the Junction alongside the heat winners of the Over 18’s Competition. 

Although Covid is very much on our minds and at the forefront of our plans we very much hope that everything goes according to plan and we will be able to once more present the very best of local music to a live audience.

If you would like to be part of this unique event you can find the entry form on the [Band Competition Facebook page ](https://www.facebook.com/CambridgeBandCompetition/) or you can email <a href='mailto:bandcomp@strawberry-fair.org.uk'>bandcomp@strawberry-fair.org.uk</a> for a direct link to the entry form.

The Cambridge Band Competition has been a fixture on the Cambridge live music scene since it began as the Cambridge Rock Competition in 1985. Strawberry Fair has been running it since 2010 and it’s the longest running competition of its format in the UK today.  Over the past 36 years the Band Competition has produced some great winners and many of the competitors have gone on to work with some top names in the industry, and all have fond recollections of being involved in the event.
