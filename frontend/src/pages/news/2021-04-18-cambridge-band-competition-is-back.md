**The Cambridge Band Competition 2023 is now open for entries, with entries closing at midnight on 8th January 2023.**

Cambridge Band Competition is about music in all its variety. Applications are welcomed from any performers of original music, from solo performers to full bands.  All genres are acceptable, so long as material is original music. Soloists, comedy musicians and classical musicians are also encouraged to apply – it’s not just about full bands, the competition is for every musician in Cambridgeshire or within 30 miles of the city of Cambridge.

The Band Competition is actually two competitions, the Over 18’s and the Under 18’s.\
Both competitions will run in tandem with each other, with the heats for the Under 18’s on the Saturday afternoons and the heats for the Over 18’s on the Saturday nights.

The Cambridge Band Competition has been a fixture on the Cambridge live music scene since it began as the Cambridge Rock Competition in 1985. Strawberry Fair has been running it since 2010 and it’s the longest running competition of its format in the UK today.  Over the past 36 years the Band Competition has produced some great winners, many of the competitors have gone on to work with some top names in the industry and all have fond recollections of being involved in the event.
