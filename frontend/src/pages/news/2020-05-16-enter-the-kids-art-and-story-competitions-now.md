We're not going to let something like a global pandemic stop us from doing everything we can to keep kids entertained! So we've teamed up with Cambridge 105 Radio and are going to put on a magical twelve hour broadcast showcasing the best bits of Strawberry Fair - including the Kids Park!

We're asking all budding artists and authors to produce something for us on the theme of Magic. There are some great prizes to be won. For more information, head on over to the Kids Park page by following the link below:
