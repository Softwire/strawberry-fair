Music for the People! Rebel Love Stage TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY @ Strawberry Fair, Midsummer Common June 11th 2022  With a line-up of ten bands and a full day of programming, The Rebel Love stage is the perfect place to dance and feel the love and joy of music with friends. Strawberry Fair is a free event, so there is no revenue from ticket sales to cover our costs; we raise money each year to bring the party. We are all volunteers, and the Rebel Love stage is run on positive energy and goodwill; even the Acts perform for free. Our Stage is a showcase for local acts and a celebration of a love of music.
