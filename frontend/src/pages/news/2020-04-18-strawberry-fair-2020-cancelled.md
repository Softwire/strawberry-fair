We are very sad to tell you that Strawberry Fair 2020 is, like many events in Cambridge and across the UK, cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

We are sure you are wondering whether we could have waited to see what happens between now and 6th June. The simple answer is that even if the pandemic was largely over by 6th June, and that is far from certain, the only way that we can make the Fair happen is if we actively fundraise and recruit volunteers. These would be constant activities from now to the end of May and doing this during a national shutdown is unrealistic and, frankly, insensitive.

By waiting, we could also be letting our traders and suppliers make investments that would be wasted if we cancel shortly before the Fair is due to happen. We have no desire to have that happen.

This is a decision that has been made by all of us together.

We are all devastated as we know the impact that cancellation will on our traders, charity partners and performers. We are thinking of other things that we could do over the Spring and Summer and then going forwards to next year's Fair.

The Fair is run and supported by volunteers who are part of their local communities and we have lots of ideas for not only including people, but entertaining them as well.

We are also looking at how to make Strawberry Fair 2021 twice as great.

Look after yourselves, stay safe and keep in touch.

We are still here, so watch this spaceâ€¦..
