We are very sad to tell you that Strawberry Fair 2020 is, like many events in Cambridge and across the UK, cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

We are sure you are wondering whether we could have waited to see what happens between now and 6th June. The simple answer is that even if the pandemic was largely over by 6th June, and that is far from certain, the only way that we can make the Fair happen is if we actively fundraise and recruit volunteers. These would be constant activities from now to the end of May and doing this during a national shutdown is unrealistic and, frankly, insensitive.

By waiting, we could also be letting our traders and suppliers make investments that would be wasted if we cancel shortly before the Fair is due to happen. We have no desire to have that happen.

This is a decision that has been made by all of us together.

We are all devastated as we know the impact that cancellation will on our traders, charity partners and performers. We are thinking of other things that we could do over the Spring and Summer and then going forwards to next year's Fair.

Strawberry Fair is run by a team of unpaid volunteers and despite the lockdown we are still meeting and planning online and we are always keen to hear from anyone who would like to join the team. More than just a day in June, the planning takes all year! We also welcome people to join us on site through the week before the Fair, at the Fair itself and after the Fair. From building the site, to spending a few hours as a steward, to working in site production, to helping with site clear-up, there is always something to do. Being involved in the Fair is also a great way to learn about event management. If you would like to learn how to plan and manage a festival from the beginning to the end get in touch and join the team. 

Look after yourselves, stay safe and keep in touch.

We are still here, so watch this spaceâ€¦..
