For over forty years, Strawberry Fair has filled Midsummer Common with art and music and poetry and love and joy and laughter and dancing and thousands of smiles.  As we could not do that this year, we partnered with Cambridge 105 Radio to bring you a virtual Strawberry Fair instead, with over 12 hours exploring each of the areas that make up Cambridge's favourite event. \
\
On the way we learned more about the history and ethos of Strawberry Fair and we met many of the volunteers who give their time and energy through the year to make the Fair happen. We learned what the areas and stages are all about, and listened to some of what they had planned to share with us all on the day, from children’s comedy and storytelling, to arts activities to activists and to music of all kinds.

It wasn’t the Strawberry Fair that we had planned to bring you, but we're really proud of the results, which you can still hear via the link below. 

## Listen again online

The Virtual Strawberry Fair 2020 is available online at the [Cambridge 105 Radio Website](https://cambridge105.co.uk/strawberry-fair-06-06-2020/), and when you have listened to it we hope that you will feel like you have been there, done that and got the T-Shirt. 

Pssst. Speaking of t-shirts, you can still get one of our [collectors' edition Strawberry Fair 2020 t-shirts](https://strawberry-fair.org.uk/about/2020-t-shirts-now-available/), which we got printed before we had the cancel the event. 

## Thank you

The Fair Committee would like to give a huge thank you to the many people involved in putting the Virtual Strawberry Fair together, including: Trevor Dann and everyone at Cambridge 105 Radio, the Audio Content Fund, and the various other community radio stations now broadcasting some or all of the content. 

Our 100% voluntary organising committee is already starting to look towards Strawberry Fair 2021, which we will start planning from September. We're always looking for fresh ideas and new members, so if this sounds interesting to you, [click here to find out more about how to get involved](https://strawberry-fair.org.uk/about/get-involved/).
