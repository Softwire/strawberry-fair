All heats will be held The Portland Arms, from 7pm – 11pm. Please ensure you are available.

The final is on Thuesday 24 October at The Junction.

The Band Competition is a fundraising event for Strawberry Fair. Any guest list will be limited to music industry professionals selected by Strawberry Fair.

A place in the final will be given to the band with the loudest cheer overall in the heats, so bands are encouraged to sell tickets to their heat so that your cheer is huge! There is a prize for the band with the most audience votes in the final so, if you get through, it is in your interest to encourage your fans to come along to the final!

## How the acts will be judged

During the heats you will be judged by people with significant experience of the music industry drawn from the local and national scene. Points are scored on Technical Ability, Innovation and Originality, Stage Presence, and the ‘Strawberry’ Factor.

All decisions taken by the promoters (Strawberry Fair) are final.

Good Luck!
