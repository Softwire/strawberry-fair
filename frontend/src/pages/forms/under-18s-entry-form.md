The Band Competition is a fundraising event for Strawberry Fair. Any guest list will be limited to music industry professionals selected by Strawberry Fair.

A place in the final will be given to the act with the loudest cheer overall in the heats, so acts and their supporters are encouraged to sell tickets to their heat so that their cheer is huge! 

## How the acts are judged

During the heats you will be judged by people with significant experience of the music industry drawn from the local and national scene. Points are scored on _Technical Ability, Innovation and Originality, Stage Presence,_ and the _‘Strawberry’ Factor_.

All decisions taken by the promoters (Strawberry Fair) are final.

**Good Luck!**
