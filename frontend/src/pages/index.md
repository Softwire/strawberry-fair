      We have had to take the hard decision to cancel Strawberry Fair 2020 as a
      result of the Coronavirus. We are devastated as a lot of work had already
      gone into making this the best fair ever. 


      We're not taking the whole year off through! Instead, we have teamed up
      with Cambridge 105 Radio and will be bringing you a **12 hour broadcast**
      on the 6th June that will feature many of the areas and acts that had been
      booked to play this year. Full details will be made available on this
      website soon, but in the meantime, [check out the press
      release](/news/2020-04-18-virtual-strawberry-fair-broadcast/). 


      Stay safe. Much love. **See you in person in 2021**!

      Instead we'll bring you a virtual event showcasing the best local

    title: Strawberry Fair 2020 Cancelled

      Strawberry Fair is a not-for-profit organisation run entirely by a team of
      volunteers (The Fairies!) who work throughout the year (yes it really does
      take that long to organise!) sorting out everything to do with the Fair;
      from finding artists and organising stages, to managing traders and
      fundraising, right through to working out how many toilets are
      needed....!!


      Strawberry Fair couldn't happen without all of the people who, generously,
      volunteer their time and effort throughout the to make our unique event
      happen. Even though there's no main event in 2020, there's still loads of
      ways you can get involved in the region's most exciting arts organisation.

  \[For re-inserting next year]




  From humble beginnings, Strawberry Fair has grown to be the most popular free,
  entirely volunteer run, one day music & arts event in Cambridge (and probably
  across Europe!), attracting over 30,000 visitors throughout the day. On the
  first Saturday of June and now passed our 40th year, residents and visitors
  have gathered together on Midsummer Common to celebrate their vibrant and
  creative city.


  The Fair is run entirely by volunteers (affectionately known as Strawberry
  Fairies) who give their energy, imagination and vision to present to their
  friends and neighbours in Cambridge a great free day out.
