      From humble beginnings, Strawberry Fair has grown to be the most popular
      free, entirely volunteer run, one day music & arts event in Cambridge (and
      probably across Europe!), attracting over 30,000 visitors throughout the
      day. On the first Saturday of June and now passed our 40th year, residents
      and visitors have gathered together on Midsummer Common to celebrate their
      vibrant and creative city.


      The Fair is run entirely by volunteers (affectionately known as Strawberry
      Fairies) who give their energy, imagination and vision to present to their
      friends and neighbours in Cambridge a great free day out.

      ## Well....


      * We've got a recycling rate that rivals Cambridge City Council, one of
      the best Councils in the country for recycling.

      * We recycle, cans (up to 10,000 cans a year), plastic and cardboard/wood.

      * We're hoping to start recycling food waste from the Crew kitchen this
      year, by donating vegetable waste to a local Community Allotment for
      composting.

      * We're trialling compostable rubbish bags for bins and litter picking.

      * We emphasise local acts on our stages to minimise vehicle use.

      * We introduced a No Paper Programme for 2022,  instead our Programme will
      be available on-line as a free app.

      * The ever popular Scarecrow Corner is a generator free zone and will be
      featuring a solar powered stage and a solar coffee bus.

      * **NO** glass bottles are allowed on-site. There are glass recycling
      points at the entrances.\
        We used to recycle 3 TONS of glass each year...
      * **NO** sales of Helium filled balloons on-site.

      * We discourage the use  of ****single use plastics on-site, including
      food serving items 

      * We've introduced a deposit return scheme for glasses from the bars and
      discouraging the sale of water in plastic water bottles.
        Water points are provided on-site.
      * We've ncreased the use of recycled/re-used/upcycled materials for our
      decor; plus, lots of our decorations, entrances and other art are
      recycled, reused or repurposed year on year.

  sale of water in plastic water bottles.

  * Increased use of only recycled/re-used/upcycled materials for our decor.

  * Emphasising local acts on our stages to minimise vehicle use.

  * Increased recycling of cardboard and plastic (along with our usual
  comprehensive recycling of drinks cans).

  * Trialling of compostable rubbish bags for bins and litter picking.

  Help! Volunteer at Strawberry Fair


  Strawberry Fair is a not-for-profit organisation run entirely by a team of
  volunteers (The Fairies!) who work throughout the year (yes it really does
  take that long to organise!) sorting out everything to do with the Fair; from
  finding artists and organising stages, to managing traders and fundraising,
  right through to working out how many toilets are needed....!!


  Strawberry Fair couldn't happen without all of the people who, generously,
  volunteer their time and effort throughout the to make our unique event
  happen. Even though there's no main event in 2020, there's still loads of ways
  you can get involved in the region's most exciting arts organisation.
