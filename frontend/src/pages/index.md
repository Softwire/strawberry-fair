      Yes, it's confirmed, Starwberry Fair will be back on **11th June 2022**
      after the longest break in its history.


      We're looking forward to catching up with old friends and making new ones,
      but we can't make it happen without [**YOU**!](/about/get-involved)


      Throughout all of everything, we did still manage to hold the popular
      Cambridge Band Competition though..... Check out the [**Band Comp**
      ](/about/cambridge-band-competition)pages for more info

  \[For re-inserting next year]


  From humble beginnings, Strawberry Fair has grown to be the most popular free,
  entirely volunteer run, one day music & arts event in Cambridge (and probably
  across Europe!), attracting over 30,000 visitors throughout the day. On the
  first Saturday of June and now passed our 40th year, residents and visitors
  have gathered together on Midsummer Common to celebrate their vibrant and
  creative city.


  The Fair is run entirely by volunteers (affectionately known as Strawberry
  Fairies) who give their energy, imagination and vision to present to their
  friends and neighbours in Cambridge a great free day out.

  Help! Volunteer at Strawberry Fair




  Strawberry Fair is a not-for-profit organisation run entirely by a team of
  volunteers (The Fairies!) who work throughout the year (yes it really does
  take that long to organise!) sorting out everything to do with the Fair; from
  finding artists and organising stages, to managing traders and fundraising,
  right through to working out how many toilets are needed....!!


  Strawberry Fair couldn't happen without all of the people who, generously,
  volunteer their time and effort throughout the to make our unique event
  happen. Even though there's no main event in 2020, there's still loads of ways
  you can get involved in the region's most exciting arts organisation.
