      Yes, it's confirmed, Strawberry Fair will be back on **11th June 2022**
      after the longest break in its history with the theme Love the Planet.


      We're looking forward to catching up with old friends and making new ones,
      but we can't make it happen without [**YOU**!](/about/get-involved)


      ## Love Our Planet


      This year we're paying even more attention than normal to taking care of
      the environment.


      We're re-doubling our recycling efforts:


      * Introducing a deposit scheme for glasses from the bars and stopping the
      sale of water in plastic water bottles.

      * Increased use of only recycled/re-used/upcycled materials for our decor.

      * Emphasising local acts on our stages to minimise vehicle use.

      * No paper Programme for 2022,  instead our Programme will be on-line as a
      free app.

      * The ever popular Scarecrow Corner is a generator free zone and will be
      featuring a solar powered stage and a solar coffee bus.

      * Increased recycling of cardboard and plastic (along with our usual
      comprehensive recycling of drinks cans).

      * Trialling of compostable rubbish bags for bins and litter picking.


      ## Shake Ya Bucket!!


      **Fancy raising some money for a charity of YOUR choice?** 


      25% of the collection is donated to the chosen charity & the 75% goes to
      Strawberry Fair.


      If you can spare some time between 11.30am and 10.30pm, please get in
      touch by emailing anaterriente8@gmail.com


      ## Cambridge Band Competition


      Throughout all of everything, we still managed to hold the popular
      [**Cambridge Band
      Competition**](https://strawberry-fair.org.uk/about/cambridge-band-competition/).


      Check out the [**Band Comp**](/about/cambridge-band-competition)
      \*\*\*\*pages for more information on the UK's longest running band
      competition.

      From humble beginnings, Strawberry Fair has grown to be the most popular
      free, entirely volunteer run, one day music & arts event in Cambridge (and
      probably across Europe!), attracting over 30,000 visitors throughout the
      day. On the first Saturday of June and now passed our 40th year, residents
      and visitors have gathered together on Midsummer Common to celebrate their
      vibrant and creative city.


      The Fair is run entirely by volunteers (affectionately known as Strawberry
      Fairies) who give their energy, imagination and vision to present to their
      friends and neighbours in Cambridge a great free day out.

  Help! Volunteer at Strawberry Fair




  Strawberry Fair is a not-for-profit organisation run entirely by a team of
  volunteers (The Fairies!) who work throughout the year (yes it really does
  take that long to organise!) sorting out everything to do with the Fair; from
  finding artists and organising stages, to managing traders and fundraising,
  right through to working out how many toilets are needed....!!


  Strawberry Fair couldn't happen without all of the people who, generously,
  volunteer their time and effort throughout the to make our unique event
  happen. Even though there's no main event in 2020, there's still loads of ways
  you can get involved in the region's most exciting arts organisation.
