      The volunteer organising committee has had to take the difficult decision
      to cancel Strawberry Fair 2021. 


      We know that this will be a huge disappointment to everyone who was
      looking forward to starting the summer of 2021 with Strawberry Fair and
      perhaps an even bigger disappointment to the traders and suppliers who
      have their own strong links to the Fair and are very much a part of the
      Strawberry Fair family.


      We are working on other things (not least the famous Cambridge Band
      Competition) that we may be able to do over the summer of 2021(watch this
      space!!) and, of course, on the return of Strawberry Fair in the summer of
      2022.

    title: No Strawberry Fair in 2021

      Strawberry Fair is a not-for-profit organisation run entirely by a team of
      volunteers (The Fairies!) who work throughout the year (yes it really does
      take that long to organise!) sorting out everything to do with the Fair;
      from finding artists and organising stages, to managing traders and
      fundraising, right through to working out how many toilets are
      needed....!!


      Strawberry Fair couldn't happen without all of the people who, generously,
      volunteer their time and effort throughout the to make our unique event
      happen. Even though there's no main event in 2020, there's still loads of
      ways you can get involved in the region's most exciting arts organisation.

  From humble beginnings, Strawberry Fair has grown to be the most popular free,
  entirely volunteer run, one day music & arts event in Cambridge (and probably
  across Europe!), attracting over 30,000 visitors throughout the day. On the
  first Saturday of June and now passed our 40th year, residents and visitors
  have gathered together on Midsummer Common to celebrate their vibrant and
  creative city.


  The Fair is run entirely by volunteers (affectionately known as Strawberry
  Fairies) who give their energy, imagination and vision to present to their
  friends and neighbours in Cambridge a great free day out.
