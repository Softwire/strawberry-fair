**At The Missing Sock**

**SATURDAY, 28 MAY 2022 AT 16:00** 

[**https://www.facebook.com/events/248936767265136**](https://www.facebook.com/events/248936767265136)****

**How about a little get-together then?**

It's been a while.

Just us, hopefully with all of you.

We've missed each other, haven't we?!

Since our old home has closed down, we've followed it to another place and we think this is going to be a great location for a reunion party!

Join us from 4pm til 3am as we serve you the treasures of two years of collecting, just for this very moment.

**‚ù§**

18+ only this time

Food available til 9pm

Limited parking available (first come first served)

Lift-shares encouraged (chat in discussion)

Tickets in advance only from here:
