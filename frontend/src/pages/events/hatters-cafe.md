## Hatters Cafe is a chilled out area for hanging out in and a meeting point for family and friends.

We have a variety of bands throughout the day and DJs in the evening. Our area is safe and secure, surrounded by a white picket fence, and inside we have our own cafe, serving a range of hot and cold beverages (some a little naughty) and cakes. There's lots going on at Hatters to keep everyone happy, so come visit us!
