Now in our second year, The Flying Pig Stage is dedicated to bringing you a great day of live music; a handpicked choice of some of the best musicians and bands we have been lucky enough to find. A mixture of styles including -  but certainly not limited to - Cajun, Americana, Funk, Blues, Rock and Roll, Folk, Jazz and Country Art Rock. Some local, including the winners of Best Acoustic Act at this year's Cambridge Band Competition, some from further afield; this year we have bands from Rome and NYC added so we feel we are truly going international!

One thing that ties these wonderful acts together  (apart from musical greatness!) is that each has at some point graced the Flying Pig pub with their presence and left a wonderful and lasting memory. We feel live music has been an important part of Strawberry Fair ever since we started attending it as teenagers and are thrilled to play a part in such a fantastic event.

All we need now is you!

Lots of love from all of us at The Flying Pig Stage
